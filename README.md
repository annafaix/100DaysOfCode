## 100DaysOfCode ... *or practice makes perfect*

This is my personal challenge based on [Weekly Coding challenge](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/weekly-coding-challenge/) and mixed with [Daily UI challenge ](https://www.dailyui.co/).

When? -> at least one hour every day
Why? -> to be (even) better front-end developer

2. **Sign in/sign up form**
